THREE PRINCIPLES OF REDUX
1.SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:
	The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree withon a single store.
2.STATE IS READ-ONLY:
	The only way to change the state is to emit an ACTION.
3.CHANGES ARE MADE WITH PURE FUNCTIONS:
	Reducers have to be pure-functions

IMMUTABILITY OF THE STATE
1.WHEN MAKING OPERATIONS WITH ARRAYS:
ã€€DO NOT USE mutable methods: push() or splice()
	USE: concat(), slice() or ...spread operator
